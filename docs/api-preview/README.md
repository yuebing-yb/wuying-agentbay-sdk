# API Preview Documentation

This directory contains automatically generated API reference documentation for the Wuying AgentBay SDKs. These files are considered **experimental/preview** and exist alongside the manually curated guides under `python/docs/api`, `typescript/docs/api`, and `golang/docs/api`.

## Layout
- `python/` – preview docs generated by `python/scripts/generate_api_docs.py`
- `typescript/` – preview docs generated by `npm run docs:generate`
- `golang/` – preview docs generated by `go run golang/scripts/generate_api_docs.go`
- `*/snapshots/` – optional historical snapshots (e.g. dated directories)

To refresh any preview docs, run the language-specific generator. Manually curated documentation remains under the original `docs/api` paths for comparison during the transition.
