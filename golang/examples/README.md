# Wuying AgentBay SDK - Go Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the Wuying AgentBay SDK in Go.

## Examples Overview

- **basic_usage/**: Demonstrates the basic usage of the SDK, including creating a session, executing commands, reading files, and cleaning up.
- **session_creation/**: Shows how to create, list, and manage multiple sessions.
- **session_params/**: Demonstrates how to use session parameters and labels.
- **context_management/**: Shows how to create, list, update, and delete contexts, and how to use them with sessions.
- **application_window/**: Demonstrates application and window management features.
- **command_example/**: Demonstrates command execution and code running features, including Python and JavaScript code execution.

## Running Examples

To run any example, navigate to the example directory and use the `go run` command:

```bash
# For example, to run the basic usage example:
cd basic_usage
go run main.go
```

## API Key

Most examples require an API key for authentication. You can provide it in two ways:

1. Set the `AGENTBAY_API_KEY` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export AGENTBAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Replace the placeholder in the example code with your actual API key (not recommended for production use).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later
- Wuying AgentBay SDK installed
