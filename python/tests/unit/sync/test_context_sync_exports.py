Unit tests for context_sync module exports

These tests ensure that all context_sync classes and enums are properly
exported from the main agentbay package, preventing import issues for users.

Related Issue: Users reported that UploadMode and Lifecycle were not available
for import from the agentbay package, even though they are required by
UploadPolicy and RecyclePolicy respectively.
